# Planning with LTL task specifications

Create an environment MDP and then a specification MDP for the LTL, we can use a standard planning algorithm on combining these two, to get a policy. 
 
Note: this is the version without state abstractions --- there is no need to combine the abstracted environment MDP and LTL task automaton here.
